## Electron
Electrons is subatomic particles with a charge of negative electricity, found in all atoms and acting as the primary carrier of electricity in solids. The presence of electrons in a byte indicate "On" and absence indicates "Off". In computer, semiconductors is used to release electrons from atoms when subjected to heat or voltage above a critical value. ‚ö°Ô∏è
## Transistor
A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify or switch electrical signals and power. It acts as a switch. Bipolar transistor has 3 terminals labeled base, collector and emitter. A small current at the base terminals can control or switch a much larger current between the collector and emitter terminals. Before transistor, there is diode which has only one N type semidonductor(extra electrons) and one P type (missing electrons) semiconductors. Eletrons will flow from N type to P type, creating a "depletion layer" where there are no longer electrons free to move. Transistor consist of three semiconductors. It can either be PNP or NPN.
