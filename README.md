## Electron
Electrons is subatomic particles with a charge of negative electricity, found in all atoms and acting as the primary carrier of electricity in solids. The presence of electrons in a byte indicate "On" and absence indicates "Off". In computer, semiconductors is used to release electrons from atoms when subjected to heat or voltage above a critical value. ‚ö°Ô∏è
## Transistor
Before transistor, there is diode which has only one N type semidonductor(extra electrons) and one P type (missing electrons) semiconductors. Eletrons will flow from N type to P type, creating a "depletion layer" where there are no longer electrons free to move. Transistor consist of three semiconductors. It can either be PNP or NPN. A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify or switch electrical signals and power. It acts as a switch. Bipolar transistor has 3 terminals labeled base, collector and emitter. A small current at the base terminals can control or switch a much larger current between the collector and emitter terminals. The emitter is a heavily doped terminal and emits electrons into the base. (Doping means addition of impurity, dopant, into a pure semiconductor in order to improve electrical properties). Base terminal is lightly doped and passes the emitter-injected electrons on to the collector. The collector terminal is moderately doped and collects electrons from base. This collector is large when compared to the other two regions so it can dissipate more heat.

## Transistor as a switch

## Logic Gates
A gate is a physical device that implements a Boolean function. The simplest gates of all are made from tiny switching devices, called transistors, wired in a certain topology designed to effect the overall gate functionality. Logic gates can be plan and optimize on a computer workstations, like Hardware Description language (HDL) and stimulate it using hardware simulator. The hardware simulator is a computer program that knows how to parse and interpret HDL code, turn it into an executable representation, and test it according to the specification of a given test script. Some common logic gates are Not, And, Or, Xor, Multiplexor, Demultiplexor. Multi-Bit Versions of basic gates is desinged to operate on multi-bit arrays called "buses". Many 2-way logic gates that accept to inputs have natural generalization to multi-way varints that accept an arbitary number of inputs.
